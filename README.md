### How It Works

1. **Add Meals:** Go to "Jade's Meals" or "Harvey's Meals" tabs and type meals for each day
2. **Add Items Manually:** Go to "Shopping List" tab and add items
3. **Auto-Generate Shopping List:** As you add meals, ingredients can be added manually
4. **Woolworths:** Click "Search Woolworths" links to add items to cart
